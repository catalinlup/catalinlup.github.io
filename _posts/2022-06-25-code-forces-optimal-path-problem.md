This article is going to discuss the optimal path problem from CodeForces ([https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1700/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1700/A)). The first section of the article provides a brief description of the problem, while the next 2 sections showcase 2 different ways of solving the problem, with dynamic programming, which is less efficient, and with mathematics, which leads to a solution of optimal space and time complexity.
