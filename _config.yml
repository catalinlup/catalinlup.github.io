  Hi, my name is Catalin Lupau and I am a machine learning engineer with a strong background in software development. I can develop and train deep learning models as well as build full-stack software applications. 
  
  My specialization is <mark>natural language processing</mark>. I have spent 9 months doing research in the field neural search, which consists of applying natural language processing (NLP) to search engines.

          I took part in 9 months of intensive research as part of TU Delft's Web Information Systems department. The aim of the research was the development of a novel vector quantization algorithm that reduces the size of neural dense indices used by modern search engines and question-answering systems. The project was successful and I am in the process of writing a scientific paper based on it to be published in an academic journal.

        title: Container Twistlock Handling Robot
        link: github.com/sproogen
        description: |
          The project consisted of developing a fully functional robot prototype to handle container twistlocks. The project was done in a team of 5 other students with various backgrounds and it involved both designing and building the robot. My role as a computer scientist was training the computer vision model to detect the twistlocks, implementing the low-level control software that would run the robot, aswellasawebapplicationfortheuserstointeractwiththerobot. The project was done as part of TU Delft's robotics minor in collaboration with Siemens, in an internship format.

        title: Red teaming large language models
        link: github.com/sproogen
        description: |
          This was a research project done in a small team and it consisted of evaluating the effectiveness of different techniques used to hack large language models into generating harmful content by bypassing their safety measures. In addition to that, we came up with and evaluated techniques that would help the large language models better resist the attacks. The outcome of the project was a dataset of malicious and protective prompts, as well as a scientific paper presenting the associated experimental results. Our paper was among the first papers on red teaming large language models and it was published in a scientific conference about AI safety.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
